# FFBS

_Farnworth's Fuck-Off Boot Strap_

Install Go then: 

```
git clone https://github.com/notthelewis/ffbs.git
```

This is some code that will setup my development environment from start to finish.
It will:
 - Install fish, nvim, tmux, alacritty, discord, 
 - Generate a unique SSH key for the machine 
 - Open up Github, to ask me to login and input the new key
 - Work out the package manager in use, download brew if on Mac
 - Bootstrap nvim
 - Bootsrap tmux


# Note

FFBS is made for me.

If you're not me, this _might_ work for you, but you'll be stuck with my keybinds... Some of which 
are cooky weird. Also, I don't intend to support you if you choose to use this tool. I can be 
mercurial, so I might help you but I also might not. 

Use at your own risk. Unless you're me, in which case: don't forget to take the bins out
